# ZeroDash

**ZeroDash** is a **lightweight, fully static Homelab dashboard** designed for fast navigation to services and applications, with optional visual monitoring — all **without running a backend, database, or plugins**.

It is a **static replacement for dashboards like Homarr and Dashy**, built with a different philosophy: keep the server simple, push intelligence to the browser, and remain easy to deploy and maintain long-term.
